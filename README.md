Data Structures
===============

Lists, Queues, Stacks
---------------------

* Simple queue and stack examples

Trees
-----

* Binary tree add, search, display, remove and distance from root
* Depth first search (Stack)
* Breadth first search (Queue)
* Auto balancing tree
* Splay tree
* BTree example
* Real world problems with trees (word rearrangement, Parse Tree, )

Heaps
-----

Graphs
------

* Single Linked List
* Graph Basics - http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=graphsDataStrucs1
* Graphs represented by nodes, graphs represented by arrays (matrix)
* Minimum Spanning Tree
* Real world problems with graphs (social network)
